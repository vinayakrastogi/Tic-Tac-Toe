# Tic-Tac-Toe
Python based Tic Tac Toe game where a player competes with simple AI

User can also pass his/her own playing symbol using command line arguments.

# How the AI Funtion Works :
 -   Function first checks if the ai can win by filling each empty place and checks for win,
     if first method doesnt result in a win, then
 -   Function checks on what position can user win, if there is a possibility that user can win, ai function uses its move there
     if second method also fails,
 -   Function selects a random empty block and uses its move there.
